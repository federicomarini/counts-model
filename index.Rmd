# About this online book {-}

This online book is a chapter of a physical book about RNA Bioinformatics.

Here I will describe how count data, as often arises in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) 
experiments, can be modeled using count distributions, as well as how 
nonparametric methods can be used to analyze count data. The book will 
cover basic routines for performing data input, normalization, 
visualization, and statistical testing to determine sets of features
where the counts reflect differences in expression across samples.
The final sections will cover downstream analyses that can be performed,
as well as limitations of the methods presented and extensions.

The code in this book includes the basic routines that can be found
in software vignettes of various Bioconductor packages, including
[tximeta](https://bioconductor.org/packages/tximeta), 
[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/DESeq2), and 
[fishpond](https://bioconductor.org/packages/fishpond). 
Please see those package vignettes for further details. Any specific 
questions about Bioconductor software should be posted to the 
Bioconductor support site:
